# Movie Search App (React.JS)

What this project is about to create a movie search app by firstly using React and then implement Redux to practice my Redux knowledge.
As far as I learn new subjects, I implement them to my project and at the end I plan to create a full stack app.

App gets data from [https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/) This is my second React and first React-Redux project.
