# Movie Search App (React.JS)

What this project is about to create a movie search app by using REACT. This is the lastest version of the app.
First, I've built the app with React. Then I've implemented respectively Redux, Redux Form, authentication with Google OAuth, React Context System and React Hooks.
Building this app has really hepled me to dive into React and its latest tools.
The next step will be implementing backend stuff to create a full stack app.

App gets data from [https://www.themoviedb.org/](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
